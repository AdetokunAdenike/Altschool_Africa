                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p><b>Name:</b> Adenike Adetokun</p>
                <p><b>AltSchool ID:</b> ALT/SOE/024/2421</p>
                <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
                <p>My name is Adenike, a mathematics graduate from the Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger
                    State. Born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, I am a first-generation graduate from a family where
                    resilience and hard work are highly valued. These values have shaped me into the determined
                    individual I am today.</p>

                <p>Growing up, education wasn’t easily accessible to me at first, but that didn’t stop my thirst for
                    knowledge. I began primary school at the age of 8, and within a year, I was excelling academically,
                    often topping my class and representing my school in debate and quiz competitions. My elder sister,
                    Rukayat, played a significant role in my early learning journey. She would teach me what she learned
                    after her daily tasks, and this laid a strong foundation for my academic success. My uncle, a
                    mathematics teacher, also inspired me by fostering my love for numbers and problem-solving, which
                    later became the cornerstone of my interest in technology.</p>

                <p>Throughout my academic journey, I was drawn to computers and intrigued by the limitless possibilities
                    technology offers. As I progressed, my curiosity grew into a passion for software engineering. I was
                    fascinated by the idea of using technology to solve real-world problems, improve systems, and make
                    life easier for others. However, self-learning proved challenging, as I struggled to find structure
                    and guidance in my studies.</p>

                    <h3>Why I joined AltSchool</h3>

                <p>My determination to succeed led me to taking the bold step to join ALTSCHOOL AFRICA, in order to
                    benefit from structured learning and live, instructor-led classes. This decision has been
                    transformative for me. Not only has it equipped me with practical skills, but it has also allowed me
                    to network with like-minded individuals and gain the confidence to pursue my dreams.</p>

                <p>Today, I am focused on building a career in tech, particularly in software engineering. My analytical
                    skills, rooted in my mathematics background, give me a unique perspective in problem-solving and
                    algorithmic thinking. I am driven by the desire to contribute to innovative solutions and make a
                    meaningful impact in the tech industry.</p>

                <p>Outside of academics and technology, I am passionate about self-development and continuous learning.
                    I believe that with determination, focus, and the right opportunities, anyone can overcome
                    challenges and achieve their goals.</p>
                <h3>GOALS</h3>
                <p>My goal is to become a world-class software engineer with expertise in building scalable, secure, and
                    efficient backend systems while mastering cloud technologies to deploy, manage, and optimize
                    solutions like a professional. I aim to leverage the knowledge gained from the Cloud Engineering
                    program at AltSchool to bridge the gap between my passion for technology and practical skills
                    required to thrive in the tech industry.
                    This program is not just a stepping stone for me; it is the foundation I need to turn my dreams into
                    reality. I want to use my skills to build impactful solutions, drive innovation, and create
                    opportunities that will not only transform my career but also rewrite my family's story, by God’s
                    grace.

                    Ultimately, I want to do what I love—pursuing software engineering and cloud computing—while
                    building a meaningful and fulfilling career that brings value to others and allows me to make a
                    lasting impact in the world of technology.</p>
